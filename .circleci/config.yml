# 1) jobs defined here are going to be used in workflows (pipeline). You can treat jobs as steps in workflow/pipeline
# 2) jobs in workflow are run in SEPARATE docker containers, so techniques like caching or storing to workspace is a common thing
# 3) jobs don't have to be run within a workflow, they can be run separately, see CircleCI documentation for that
